# Housing-Prices-EDA-and-Prediction
The Housing dataset is a classic dataset used in regression analysis and predictive modeling. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Housing dataset typically involves the following steps:
Data Inspection: Checking the first few rows of the dataset, data types, and missing values.

Summary Statistics: Calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for each attribute.

Data Visualization: Creating visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.

Correlation Analysis: Calculating the correlation matrix to identify the relationships between features and the target variable.

Outlier Detection: Identifying and handling outliers that may affect model accuracy.

Data Preprocessing: Scaling, normalizing, or encoding features as needed for modeling.
